# My Personal Project

### About This Project
- My project is an application that will simulate a Pokémon battle sequence 
  between two Pokémon, where a player encounters a random Pokémon
  and is then forced to fight it with one of their own Pokémon.

### Intended Audience
- My intended, target audience for this application is casual, or avid, Pokémon enthusiasts
  that love the battling aspect of the Pokémon game, or want to understand the battle mechanics.

### My Inspirations and Aspirations for this Project
- Growing up playing many video games on consoles such as the PS2 and Game Boy, 
  games like Pokémon became a big part of my childhood. 
  Inspired by the games I played I had always wanted to build my own complex game, 
  but never learned the proper tools to do so.
  With this project I hope to achieve my goal by re-creating the most fun aspect that drew me into the game of Pokémon,
  and finally build a game I enjoy.
